/* The video game machines at your local arcade output coupons according
 * to how well you play the game. You can redeem 10 coupons for a candy bar
 * or 3 coupons for a gumball. You prefer candy bars to gumballs. Write a
 * Java program that reads the number of coupons you have and outputs how
 * many candy bars and gumballs you can get if you spend all of your coupons
 * on candy bars first, and any remaining coupons on gumballs.
